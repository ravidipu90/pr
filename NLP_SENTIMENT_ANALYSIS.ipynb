Then we discussed my current PCP and how current I am on lab work etc.  I mentioned I have stayed very current through my current PCP (Dr. Roger Mathews with Conifer Medical Center) and that I have my PSA done annually.  Before I could mention I have had very high levels in the past leading to prostate biopsy, Dr. Curtis chose to inform me that PSA testing and some other test are not proven to be helpful in recent years.  This and other comments made by Dr. Curtis using his big vocabulary with medical jargon rather than talking to me in plain English was not impressive (I got the gist, I am an educated professional).  I can speak in lots of acronyms and big words too, however, most people including myself appreciate keeping it simple and to the point.  I will continue to have an annual PSA test done for my own health and peace of mind regardless of the \"current study data\" regurgitated from Dr. Curtis.

He seemed very interested in promoting himself & his services rather than being a healthcare teammate on MY team. When I visited previously there was a temporary doctor, Dr. Udin (possibly Odin) I believe, who was hands-down fantastic. He listened to 'my' story and asked relevant questions rather than making assumptions out loud the way Dr. McCay did. Other than the doctor, I was also set back by things out of my control. For example, somehow the doctors office had 9 patient profiles for me; none of them with my correct info. Because of this I had a terrible time getting access to the online portal and viewing lab results. I was told the info was sent over from Humana, which is fine, but there should have been a printout or something to look over & verify the info was correct. This delay was completely avoidable. Overall, I would not recommend friend/family to visit this office, as I am not someone who is uneducated looking for a doctor to boss me around. Instead, I have worked in healthcare over 10+ years and appreciate when a physician is knowledgeable to current healthcare practices and research rather than an outdated view. This is something I've seen not just in this office but in many offices with older, white, American doctors. I do not feel they are properly trained in common-sense things, such as the benefits of a vegetarian diet. One mention of my diet and Dr. McCay stated it would be insufficient for pregnancy or otherwise due to low protein/Vit B. As demonstrated by my labs this was not at all true for me, as all labs were in normal range. It is assumptions like this that cause me to question anything the doctor says, as I find myself wondering if he is really up-to-date in his knowledge. Specifically, on this issue, it was as if the doctor had no idea millions of people around the world have vegetarian diets and have had such for centuries.\", 'I am a new member but so far it seems to be ok.', 'First - very unprofessional that at the front desk there is a stuffed pile of \"poo\" on top of a file cabinet.

Medical records, by the way, which he never asked for. He also repeatedly asked me questions about drug abuse and selling drugs like he thought I was some common criminal. I understand that many of these questions may be legally required but the fact that he would ask them multiple times like he was trying to catch me (when I haven't done anything wrong) was very offensive. In addition, because I work out he implied that I might be taking testosterone or growth hormone. He also had-mouthed my previous physician saying he's going to get locked up by the DEA because of the scripts he was writing me. On that note, that won't happen because my previous physician would not have been able to get those scripts filled by the company Express Scripts if they violated any laws. That is a very large pharmaceutical company and they are very strict about those things.  Overall, this was the worst experience I've ever had with any kind of doctor. He was rude, offensive, and rambled a lot with no clear direction or purpose. I would not recommend Dr. Wang to ANYONE.\", 'I have a history of Depression in myself as well as my family.

It dissipated somewhat this last month however after the doctor palpating the upper area, it flared up severely causing burning pain all the way through my arms, shoulders, entire upper back.  I truly believe there is something impinging on a nerve since it burns and feels like the entire upper back is being ripped apart.  I was given no x-ray.  This was my experience however others may not have the same issue. The doctor was very cordial, very attentive given the amount of issues I went in with.  Also, I went in because I have been having diaphragmatic spasms (perhaps) which also started when my back pain started-exactly at the same time. This again was back in November. However two weeks ago, I began having some gastritis. The doctor prescribed proton-inhibitor and said the gastritis is causing the diaphragmatic hiccupping, wretching. Again, I believe there was too much information for her but I needed her to understand that the diaphragmatic problem began almost 4-5 months ago and the gastritis just within the last 2 weeks.

Chest xray done on a Thursday at SSM - ready the same day.  I had to call XYZ because I had not heard anything on Monday and they had to call SSM.  Seems that there should have been better follow through on this.',\n",

Tried to search on HI! but got useleses search results. So finally just went down to the Tower location and asked how I could make an appointment. The desk girl seemed annoyed, but said she could help me. I said I was sick and needed to see someone. She gave some afternoon hours availability. I asked if there was anything sooner and she said 9:15. Stupidly, I took it. She asked me to come right back (8:45) with my ID and Ins card which I did, and got me processed in, then I waited. Was told I\\'d be seen right in just a few minutes at 9:20, and was ushered in at 9:30 - now missing a meeting with my boss. Processsing by the nurse was slow. I know he probalby thinks that by being slow it provides a sense of \"you matter to me\" but all it was screaming to me was - \"we\\'re on my time now and I\"m gonna take my time\". Then, had to wait for the doctor to get finished with another patient, normal but mind, this is now 30 minutes after the appoinment time and I\\'d now been there an hour. after 10 minutes, doc was available, but they couldn\\'t get the audio to work (really?!?) and said I could either go down to the location where the doctor actually was, or come back later that afternoon \"which ever was conveneint\". well, as a sick person, who was very sick, and did not have time to be there or be sick, neither was \"convenient.\" I would like to remind you that people like me, people who are 98% healthy and don\\'t go to the doctor for every little sniffle, people who use these kinds of facilities all have one thing in common - we DON\"T HAVE TIME.

I was not given the opportunity to re-schedule my appointment, the receptionist never came to check in on me nor to let me know the doctor was running late-by the time he showed up I was extremely frustrated. The lack of professionalism and lack of concern for my time is just not acceptable in my book.  If the receptionist had said, listen, the doctor is running late would you like to reschedule-and let me decide if I want to stay and wait or reschedule-by far better.  I went in to renew a prescription for my inner ear problem and to get FMLA paper work filled out-it was getting ready to expire, the doctor used a marker which bled through he apologized, which was fine, I faxed the office a new one he stated he would get it to me that day (Friday).  I finally had to call Friday at 4:30, office is closed.  I called the Pueblo office, they stated no they are opened till 5-I explained I got the answering machine and that\\'s what it stated.  She put me on hold, called the Canon office...got back on line with me and said the doctor would get it to me yet that evening.  I had to call back Tuesday because I hadn\\'t received it,  spoke with receptionist and finally got it that afternoon.  So I send it to Risk Management for Department of Corrections (my employer) they explained that it was extremely vague and asked me to contact my doctor and ask that he change the wording.  They gave me wording from my last one-I called the office gave the receptionist the information.  Well, he sends me an email, doesn\\'t call to discuss this, sends an email!  He closes his email to me \"if patient would like to discuss her concerns she can make an appointment.\"  Are you kidding me?

While there, Dr. Shuherk checked her strep, etc.  Computers were down.  They handed Lindsay a note scrawled on a blue envelope.  On the blue envelope was scrawled an address, and a time.  Apparently, Dr. Shuherk was sending her to see an ear, nose and throat specialist regarding some problem with her ear.  We do not even have a CLUE what the problem IS.  And there is no dr. name or phone number written on the blue envelope.  Although my husband was there with our daughter, Dr. Shuherk never said a single word to my husband.  No word about what was wrong, why he was sending her to another Dr, etc.  Also, Jasmine randomly made the appointment for Lindsay to see the ENT dr at 1:30 p.m. the next day, without consulting my husband.  Lindsay doesn't get out of school until 3, and cannot miss school.  We were very, VERY frustrated with the whole situation.  Since then, we have been waiting 2 days for Jasmine to call us back, since we cannot contact the ENT guy directly, because we do not know who he is, or what his phone number is!\",\n",

How can a doctor see their patient when suddenly their chart isn't available to them or the video doesn't work?  I also don't understand why company business meetings are scheduled after patients appointments have already been made - I've had an appointment cancelled because management prioritized branding/marketing meetings/events.  Branding took precedent over patient care - disappointing to be canceled out of the blue for that reason. Suggest that appointments also be available after school hours at both locations for convenience - because of the 2 different locations and limited work schedules of the practitioners, appointments aren't easy to get.
